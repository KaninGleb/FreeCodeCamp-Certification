// ❓DESCRIPTION
// The previous challenges covered component state and how to initialize state in the constructor.
// There is also a way to change the component's state.
// React provides a method for updating component state called setState.
// You call the setState method within your component class like so: this.setState(),
// passing in an object with key-value pairs. The keys are your state properties and the values are the updated state data.
// For instance, if we were storing a username in state and wanted to update it, it would look like this:
//
// this.setState({
//   username: 'Lewis'
// });
//
// React expects you to never modify state directly, instead always use this.setState() when state changes occur.
// Also, you should note that React may batch multiple state updates in order to improve performance.
// What this means is that state updates through the setState method can be asynchronous.
// There is an alternative syntax for the setState method which provides a way around this problem.
// This is rarely needed but it's good to keep it in mind! Please consult our React article for further details.


// 🎯 Assignment
// There is a button element in the code editor which has an onClick() handler.
// This handler is triggered when the button receives a click event in the browser,
// and runs the handleClick method defined on MyComponent. Within the handleClick method,
// update the component state using this.setState(). Set the name property in state to equal the string React Rocks!.
//
// Click the button and watch the rendered state update.
// Don't worry if you don't fully understand how the click handler code works at this point.
// It's covered in upcoming challenges.


// ✅ SOLUTION
import {Component} from "react";

class MyComponent extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      name: 'Initial State'
    }
    this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);
  }

  handleClick() {
    // Change code below this line
    this.setState({
      name: 'React Rocks!'
    })
    // Change code above this line
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <button onClick={this.handleClick}>Click Me</button>
        <h1>{this.state.name}</h1>
      </div>
    )
  }
}
