// ❓DESCRIPTION
// So far, you've learned that JSX is a convenient tool to write readable HTML within JavaScript.
// With React, we can render this JSX directly to the HTML DOM using React's rendering API known as ReactDOM.
//
// ReactDOM offers a simple method to render React elements to the DOM which looks like this:
// ReactDOM.render(componentToRender, targetNode), where the first argument is the React element or component that
// you want to render, and the second argument is the DOM node that you want to render the component to.
//
// As you would expect, ReactDOM.render() must be called after the JSX element declarations,
// just like how you must declare variables before using them.


// 🎯 Assignment
// The code editor has a simple JSX component. Use the ReactDOM.render() method to render this component to the page.
// You can pass defined JSX elements directly in as the first argument and use document.getElementById() to select
// the DOM node to render them to. There is a div with id='challenge-node' available for you to use.
// Make sure you don't change the JSX constant.


// ✅ SOLUTION
const JSX = (
  <div>
    <h1>Hello World</h1>
    <p>Lets render this to the DOM</p>
  </div>
)

const div = document.getElementById('challenge-node')

ReactDOM.render(JSX, div)
